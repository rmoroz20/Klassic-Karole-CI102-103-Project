# Klassic Karole -Team 70Uhhh...:)

[[_TOC_]]

## Description

Klassic Karole is a turn based RPG, where you play as a mom that fights other PTA moms in a PTA meeting to become the President of the PTA meeting. Fight through battles in a satirical experience using outlandish, barbaric techniques, such as throwing a chair at someone, pointing an accusatory finger, and anything else to physically and emotionally cripple your enemies!

## Our Motivation

Klassic Karole is intended to be a fun, exaggerated and interesting take on an entirely mundane experience that so many have witnessed in small doses. The team valued uniqueness and team satisfaction with out work over any other measure of success and first and foremost wanted to make a game that we ourselves would enjoy playing. We wanted to create for ourselves, rather than just the minimum requirements of the class, and thus Klassic Karole truly began to take its final form.
