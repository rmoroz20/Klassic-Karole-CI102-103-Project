## Description

Klassic Karole is a turn based RPG, where you play as a mom that fights other PTA moms in a PTA meeting to become the President of the PTA meeting. Fight through battles in a satirical experience using outlandish, barbaric techniques, such as throwing a chair at someone, pointing an accusatory finger, and anything else to physically and emotionally cripple your enemies!

## Our Motivation

Klassic Karole is intended to be a fun, exaggerated and interesting take on an entirely mundane experience that so many have witnessed in small doses. The team valued uniqueness and team satisfaction with out work over any other measure of success and first and foremost wanted to make a game that we ourselves would enjoy playing. We wanted to create for ourselves, rather than just the minimum requirements of the class, and thus Klassic Karole truly began to take its final form.

## Code Conventions

[Python Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)- Main source for our coding practices and style while creating this game.

Note: When naming variables, majority of instances, Camel Case is used, but occasionally specific circumstances call for [Snake Case](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snake-case-given-sentence/).

## Installation

To get started in playing Klassic Karole download the necessary zipped file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i8eYutGZrnkeq6MXsXqAzIFMZtUCH2Su/view?usp=sharing).

**Note: Mac OS and GNU/Linux Users should first download and install their correct version of [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download)**

### Downloading Game Files from Site

Upon clicking the link, you will be faced with a screen showing the zipped KlassicKarole.zip file

From there click on the small download arrow symbol in the top right corner of the screen.

### Extracting Game Files

Once the zipped file has been downloaded, the user should open it and extract all encased files.

The first thing the user will see is a directory called "main" and they will know that the extraction was successful. 

### Running Main Game File
That main directory should be opened and from there the user will see a variety of different files.

**All the user needs to do is find the file named *main.exe*, click on it twice and the game will run from there.**
